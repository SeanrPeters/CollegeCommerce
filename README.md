# CollegeCommerce

We were originally going to work on an existing project as our capstone project but due to us wanting to eventually patent this project, we are now going with a different idea. Currently we want to make an ecommerce website that visualizes products being sold or donated on a map. An image of the product, the price and a general location of the user trying to sell this product will be displayed on a google maps like interface. Once an offer is accepted by the seller, their specific location will be shown during an agreed upon time. Some features can include a search bar and filer that will help buyers find specific items being sold. After searching and plugging in the desired filters, the website will then provide the user with a list of items being sold and their general distance from them. What makes this website different from other ecommerce sites like eBay or Facebook Marketplace is that is specifically meant for college students. An example of a person that might prefer this kind of website over something like eBay would be a college student that has graduated and is now moving out of their dorm but does not want to bring everything with them. Things like old college books and school supplies could be donated to or sold to a nearby student that need these things.
